# AutoExpertise
ASP.NET MVC and SVG based web application.

Instead of the actual picture(.img, .jpeg etc.) , SVG technology is used for modelling the car.

When the user creates the record of the vehicle, the damage status, dyed / changed, and so on. (The color codes are represented on the vehicle for changing situations.)
